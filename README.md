# React Bootstrap Sass

This is a simple [Bootstrap][bs-site] project demonstrating how to use [Sass][sass-site] without having painstakingly attempt to override Bootstrap styles with custom CSS


## Overview

Frameworks such as **[Bootstrap][bs-site]** are popular in part because writing and debugging your own custom CSS to work across [all browsers][w3s-browser] _and_ [devices][mdn-css-device-compatibility] is like a _sweaty octopus trying to unhook a bra_.

**[Sass/Scss][sass-site]** is [CSS preprocessor][mdn-css-preprocessor]--a *powerful* language in which you can use basic programming concepts in your stylesheets like *functions* and *variables*, not to mention be able to *nest* your styles!

**[Create-React-App][cra-site]** makes implementing the above two technologies [so][cra-sass] damn [simple][cra-bs]!
